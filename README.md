## Description

The employee tracker application is a CMS application that allows a user to view, add, and modify data from the database. This application allowed me to explore the mysql2 package which allowed me to run sql queries within my functions. In the future, I would like to add more functionality to the application such as, deleting an employee, updating an employee manager, etc.
